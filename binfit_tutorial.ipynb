       "\n",
       "Another fork of the `TemplateFitter` package is being actively developed by [Felix Metzner](mailto:felix.metzner@kit.edu), also [on github](https://github.com/FelixMetzner/TemplateFitter).

       "There is a `docs/` directory which is meant to contain sphinx package documentation (what basf2 uses) in RestructuredText (rst format), but the installation instructions there are outdated. Maybe that will change. Feel free to contribute if you want.\n",

       "Max had already given a nice tutorial for his package at the October 2019 B2GM.\n",
       "In his talk he gave a very nice overview on the theory of template fitting, so I recommend you to look at his [slides](https://indico.belle2.org/event/1158/contributions/4726/attachments/2809/4241/b2gm_templatefitter.pdf). If you want to try out Max' `TemplateFitter`, e.g. to compare it to `binfit`, there's already good [tutorials](https://github.com/welschma/TemplateFitter/blob/master/examples/basic_example.ipynb) in his packages `examples` folder. Also, his package has a nice sphinx [online-documentation on readthedocs](https://templatefitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\n",
